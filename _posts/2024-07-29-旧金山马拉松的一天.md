Yesterday, July 28th, was the date of the San Francisco Marathon. Here is a brief introduction: “The San Francisco Marathon was held on July 28, 2024, celebrating its 47th anniversary. This iconic event featured several race options, including the full marathon, two half marathons, a 5K, and an ultramarathon. The marathon course is known for its scenic route through the city, offering stunning views of landmarks such as the Golden Gate Bridge, Fisherman's Wharf, and the Embarcadero.” As a city event, SFM attracted 31,000 participants. I originally planned to register, but the registration fee was too expensive, so I decided to volunteer with my running club. Let me share my volunteer experience.

On that day, I carpooled to San Francisco with Frank, the leader of our club. Since the race started early, we met at 5:30 AM and drove to Fulton St. Our main work area was at the finish line of the first half marathon, near the rose garden in Golden Gate Park. Our assigned task was to arrange bananas. We had to take the bananas out of the boxes and place them on the tables to distribute to the finishers. We started working around 6:30 AM, and since the race hadn't started yet, we kept arranging the bananas. The race started at 7:00 AM, and runners, including running clubs, began to pass by, with volunteers cheering them on. At 8:14 AM, the first half marathon finisher reached the finish line. I was lucky enough to capture his sprint finish and even took a photo with him. By around 9:00 AM, more and more finishers arrived, creating a bustling scene at the finish line. I was responsible for distributing granola bars. Many people smiled and said thank you. I saw many Chinese running groups and Asian faces during this time. By around 10:00 AM, the crowd started to thin out, and by 11:00 AM, most of the runners had finished. Volunteers then cleaned up the tables. The busiest time was between 9:00 and 10:00 AM, as most finishers arrived during this period. You could see people from different countries, including China, Korea, Mexico, and India. Some carried their national flags, making them easy to identify, and one person even wore a costume resembling traditional Chinese minority attire with silver accessories.

Dave, a member of our club, was my partner in distributing food. He is an Asian guy, and I learned a lot from working with him. First, he was very proactive about the job. What we thought was an ordinary task of distributing food, he found interesting. He said something like, "Don’t you find it fascinating to see people from different races, countries, and professions here?" He also mentioned that the runners at the back needed more energy to complete the race because they had to put in more effort. He truly loved running and encouraging runners. During his runs, he always encouraged others, and while distributing food, he cheered loudly for every finisher, guiding them on where to collect their medals and finishers’ shirts. Although there was no formal training for volunteers, Dave clearly put his heart into the job. He was passionate about the simple tasks, like a sun radiating enthusiasm that affected everyone around him. He also kept track of our club's runners’ progress and cheered loudly whenever one of our members approached.

Now let’s talk about Frank. Frank was the first person I ran with when I joined the club. I was surprised because Frank looked at least sixty years old. This is common in the US, but I felt ashamed of my running speed because he could keep up with me despite his age. Actually, he is 67 years old and still running, which is inspirational for someone like me who runs sporadically. He started running in high school with a training team and a coach, unlike me, who just runs casually. I can’t remember the mileage he mentioned from his summer training, but it sounded significant. He said he wasn’t top-tier but above average in his training team. If it was a small private high school, he could beat 80-90% of the trainees. I thought he was being modest. We also talked about his marathon experiences. He ran his first San Francisco Marathon in 2000 at forty years old. He admitted to doing some foolish things back then, like underestimating the hills, resulting in him walking most of the second half and finishing in four hours. Information wasn’t as accessible back then, and training plans weren’t as scientific, so it’s understandable he wasn’t fully prepared. I was amazed that someone I knew had participated in the 2000 San Francisco Marathon. Twenty years have passed just like that. Frank is like a living fossil of marathons. We also discussed the importance of training. Frank said he felt discouraged because training was still effective in his fifties, but not so much now. However, he still benefited from a healthy body due to exercise. Besides, he remembered our first conversation from over six months ago. Frank’s passion for running is evident. He started training young, participated in marathons, and now manages the running club. He’s a responsible and humble person, not as humorous as others, but with a wealth of experience and stories for young runners to learn from. Everyone was young once, but when you get older, will you still hold on to your youthful passions?

昨天是7月28号，旧金山马拉松的比赛时间。简要介绍如下：“旧金山马拉松于2024年7月28日举行，庆祝其第47个周年纪念。这项标志性的赛事包括全程马拉松、两个半程马拉松、一个5K赛和一个超马拉松。马拉松路线以其城市中的风景如画而闻名，提供了如金门大桥、渔人码头和滨海大道等地标的壮丽景色。” 作为一个城市的赛事，SFM吸引了31,000名参赛者。本来我也打算报名，无奈报名费实在太贵了，我决定和我们跑步俱乐部的人一起报名当志愿者，讲讲我的志愿者经历吧。

当天，我和我们俱乐部的负责人Frank一起拼车前往三番，由于比赛很早，我们早上五点半汇合，开车到了Fulton St。我们工作的主要区域在上半场半马的终点，金门公园的rose garden附近。我们被分配的工作是摆放香蕉，需要把一整盒香蕉拿出来摆放在桌上，等到给完赛的人分配。我们大概六点半开始工作，由于比赛还未开始，我们就一直在摆放香蕉，等到七点比赛开始，一些选手包括跑团陆陆续续路过，有志愿者给他们加油。等到八点十四，第一位半马完赛选手到达终点，我有幸捕捉到他的冲刺画面，还和他合影。到了九点左右，完赛选手越来越多，人潮涌动，整个终点站被人群淹没，我一直在负责派发Granola，基本很多人都会微笑着说谢谢，此间还看到了很多中国跑团以及亚裔面孔。时间到了十点多，人渐渐会少一些，到十一点基本上所有人都完赛了，志愿者就负责清理一些桌面，整个过程九十点最忙，大部分完赛者都在这个时间。现场能看到很多不同国家的人，有一些中国选手，韩国的，墨西哥的，印度的，有的人把国旗带在身上或者手上，比较容易辨认，还有的穿了马里奥的衣服，一个人好像是穿了类似中国少数民族的服饰还带了银饰。

和我一起派发食物的是我们俱乐部的Dave，他是一个亚裔，和他一起工作，我学到了很多。首先，他对工作非常积极主动，我们认为很平常的食物派发工作，在他看来很有意思，他的原话大概是，你不觉得能在这里看到不同种族国家不同职业的人很有意思吗？并且那些跑在后面的人，他们需要更多的精力来完成这个比赛，他们付出的更多，每个人都在为了这个比赛努力。我觉得他是真的很喜欢跑步，并且喜欢鼓励选手。他平时跑步的时候就会给其他人很多鼓励，在发放食物的时候，他扯着嗓子给每个完赛选手加油，告诉大家在哪里领取奖牌和完赛衣服。现场负责人其实并没有给志愿者有任何培训，你愿意怎么做都是你的事，但Dava显然做足了工作，他对这些简单的事情充满了热情，他像一个太阳，所有人都会被他的热情感染。他还一直在追踪我们俱乐部的参赛者的跑步进度，只要我们的人跑到附近，他就会大声加油。

说完了Dave，我再说说Frank吧。Frank是我第一天到俱乐部和我一起跑步的，我当时就很惊讶，因为Frank看上去起码有六十岁了，尽管这在美国很常见，由于我觉得我还年轻，他的跑步速度可以和我一样，我为我的速度感到羞愧哈哈。还有一点是，他实际六十七了，他还在坚持跑步，对于断断续续跑步的我来说，不得不说是一个榜样。并且他在年轻的时候，是一个更为严肃的跑者，据他所说，他从高中开始跑步，他是和一个训练队还有教练一起，不是我那种普通的自己跑两步。我有些不记得他说夏天他们的跑量了，但听起来是一个很大的数字，他还说那时候他在训练队里也不算很顶尖的，比平均水平要好一些，但如果是在一个私立的高中，人比较少的话，他可以打败百分之八九十的训练者，我心想那你还是谦虚了啊。然后我们聊到了，他的马拉松经历，他说他两千年的时候第一次跑旧金山马拉松，那时候他四十岁，我想他四十岁的时候应该还是挺厉害的。他说他当时有点蠢，干了很多蠢事，可能没有科学训练，低估了那个坡，导致他后半程都是走完的，最后花了四个小时完赛。那时候信息没有现在这么发达，训练计划也没有现在这么诚实，他没有做好准备也很正常。我真的很惊讶，我身边有人参加2000年的旧金山马拉松，二十多年就这样过去了，Frank真是马拉松的活化石。我们还聊到了跑步训练的重要性，Frank说他觉得有些灰心，因为训练在他五十岁的时候还很有效果，只要刻苦训练就可以提升很多，但五十岁以后，效果没那么明显了。但他还是得到了一些好处，因为运动带来的健康身体。我觉得除此以外还有记忆里，他记得我第一次和他聊天的内容，那大概是大半年前了。我在Frank身上也看到了对跑步的热情，他年轻的时候开始训练，参加马拉松，现在在负责跑步俱乐部，他是那种很负责很认真的人，也很谦虚，他或许不像其他人那么幽默，但他在跑步上有很多经验和经历值得我们年轻人去学习。谁没有年轻过呢，当你老的时候，你是否还能坚持年轻时的热爱呢？
