Recently, I started using the voice feature of ChatGPT, and the human-computer interaction is much better than I expected. This is partly due to the maturity of speech-to-text technology and the rapid response and accuracy of the model’s answers, which greatly impressed me. The much-talked-about Dan mode conversation online, I never thought it could be used to learn English. Previously, I tried using a web-based voice plugin, but the experience was mediocre and did not motivate me to continue learning. However, after using the voice feature on the mobile app recently, the smoothness of the conversation made me more amazed by ChatGPT. The current model has evidently reached a high level, no longer the “artificial idiot” as we traditionally thought. At least in terms of conversation relevance, the responses are very relevant, though whether they are the answers you need is subjective. Using the voice feature to learn a language is completely feasible; in terms of English, ChatGPT's language proficiency can probably rival that of native speakers. Although I don’t know the language generation mechanism, at least from my experience, ChatGPT’s grammar and word usage are very accurate. ChatGPT’s speech-to-text is also very smooth, ensuring that your conversation won’t be interrupted by such issues. Sometimes the model might stop responding, which is an unavoidable technical issue. Balancing a huge amount of traffic and response speed, especially under such high model usage, is incredibly complex for someone like me who is an AI outsider. At this stage, using normal conversation as a measure, ChatGPT can achieve 70-80% accuracy.

The voice conversation feature can greatly help me practice speaking. It’s like having a 24-hour personal tutor, with an astonishing vocabulary and sentence pool. AI’s learning speed is incredibly fast; as long as the model is trained with a large amount of linguistic data, it can quickly master it. After all, how much new data can there be in a language? Seeing AI’s rapid language learning ability, I can’t help but think that the teaching profession might no longer be necessary. AI can learn and train on a vast amount of existing knowledge tirelessly. Humans cannot have such a huge knowledge base, and teachers’ knowledge is limited and doesn’t need frequent updates. Another advantage of ChatGPT is cost; with just the model and API, we can get unlimited resources from AI. Learning a language itself is just a process of repetition without the need for new knowledge. Moreover, AI isn’t weak in logic. Currently, there are many detailed issues to resolve for the comprehensive application of AI with other disciplines before it can be fully implemented. In terms of language functions, ChatGPT is very mature. Using AI to practice speaking, writing, and reading for free is an excellent tool. The future development of AI will likely disrupt many industries, but the visible changes are already happening slowly.

However, I can’t help but wonder, if AI truly learns to think, what should we do? Imagine if we are watching low-quality text pieced together by AI every day, looking at AI-edited pictures, AI-edited videos, and AI-created music. These creations lack emotion and real-life experiences. Do we really want to live in such a virtual world? What if one day we can no longer distinguish between content created by AI and humans? How should we handle that situation?

最近才正式开始使用ChatGPT的语音功能，现在的人机对话已经比我之前想象的要好，一方面得益于语音转文字的技术成熟，另一方面模型的反应迅速，以及生成回答的准确度这些都让我大为感慨。一直在网上很火的Dan模式对话，我都没想过可以用来学英语，此前尝试过用网页版语音插件，体验感比较一般，并没有让我有持续学习的动力，但是近期用了移动端的语音功能，对话的顺畅度让我对ChatGPT更加惊叹。现在的模型显然已经发展到一个高度，不再是我们传统认为的人工智障，至少从对话关联度来说，回答的东西都是很相关的，至于是不是你需要的答案，这个确实见仁见智。我用语音功能用来学习语言是完全可以的，在英语方面，ChatGPT的语言水平也许可以和母语者有得一拼，虽然不知道语言生成的机制，至少从体验来说，ChatGPT的语法用词都很准确。ChatGPT的语音转文字也很丝滑，让你们的对话不会因为这方面的问题中断。模型有时候会中断响应，这是没有办法的事情，技术的问题有时候并不容易克服，特别是在模型的流量如此之大的情况下，如何平衡庞大的访问量和响应速度，对我这个AI的门外汉来说，还是一个无比复杂的问题。现阶段来说，用正常对话来衡量ChatGPT，已经可以达到百分之七八十了。

语音对话功能可以很好的帮助我练习口语，一个随时随地的二十四小时贴身外教，词汇量和句子量都是很惊人的。AI的学习速度是很快的，只要把大量语料给模型训练，模型很快可以掌握，毕竟语言能有多少新数据可以学习呢。在看到AI如此迅速的语言学习能力后，我不禁感慨，教师这个行业真的可以不必存在了，AI可以大量学习和训练已有的知识，并且不知疲倦地学习，人类绝不可能有这么庞大的知识库，老师教授的知识也有限，甚至不需要更新换代。另外一个ChatGPT的优势就是成本，只需要模型和程序接口，我们可以从AI中获取无限资源，学习语言本身也只是一个不断重复的过程，在此过程中并不需要产生什么新的知识，更何况AI在逻辑方面也并不弱。目前AI和其他学科的综合应用还有很多细节问题需要解决，一个完整的应用才能落地，从语言功能来说，ChatGPT可以说非常成熟了，用AI来免费练习口语写作和阅读，简直是语言利器，AI的发展未来不知道还要颠覆多少行业，但肉眼可见的变化已经在慢慢发生。

可是我还是不禁想问，如果AI真的学会了思考，我们又该做些什么，想象我们每天看的都是一些低质量AI拼凑来的文字，看一些AI修过的图片，AI剪辑的视频，AI创作的音乐，这些创作已经没有情感和真实的生活体验，我们真的要活在这样虚拟的世界里吗？甚至有一天，我们根本分辨不出AI和人类创作的内容的时候，我们又该如何自处呢？
